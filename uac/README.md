# UAC - Unix-like Artifacts Collector

(Only works on linux)
The Unix-like Artifacts Collector (UAC) tool gathers digital data from Unix-based systems for forensic analysis. It captures logs, user activities, network connections, and system configurations to aid in investigating security incidents. UAC automates data collection, supports multiple Unix-like OSes, and generates detailed reports for forensic analysis.
