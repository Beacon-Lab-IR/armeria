# THOR Scanner Lite
THOR Scanner Lite is a security tool designed for scanning and identifying potential security vulnerabilities and threats within computer systems. It is specifically focused on detecting indicators of compromise (IOCs), malware, and suspicious activities that may indicate a security breach. THOR Scanner Lite performs deep scans of systems, looking for signs of malicious software, unusual behaviors, and security weaknesses.

This tool is commonly used by security professionals, incident responders, and system administrators to enhance the security posture of their systems, detect and respond to security incidents swiftly, and prevent potential threats from causing harm. THOR Scanner Lite provides detailed reports and insights to help users understand the security status of their systems and take appropriate actions to mitigate risks.
