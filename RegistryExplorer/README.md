# RegistryExplorer

Registry Explorer is a tool that allows users to view and edit the Windows Registry, which is a hierarchical database that stores configuration settings and options for the operating system and installed applications. This tool provides a user-friendly interface for navigating the registry, inspecting keys and values, searching for specific entries, and making changes when necessary.

Registry Explorer is often used for tasks such as troubleshooting system issues, analyzing registry entries for malware or suspicious activity, and customizing system settings. It can be a valuable tool for system administrators, IT professionals, and advanced users who need to work with the Windows Registry in a more efficient and organized manner.

## Getting started
